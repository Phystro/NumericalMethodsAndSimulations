# Introduction to numerical methods

## Derivatives (Differential Equations)

- Euler Method for first order-differential equations
- Differential equations of any order
- Introduction to 4th-order Runge-Kutta method for initial value problems
- Shooting method for boundary value problems

## Integrals (Numerical Integration)

Techniques:

- Rectangular approximation
- Trapezoid rule
- Simpson's/Parabolic approximation
- Romberg integration
- Gaussian quadrature

## Mini Projects

- n-body problem - gravitational n-body problem simulation of a dynamical system of particles interacting with each other gravitationally.

- Particle hydrodynamics Simulation - simulate a star with smoothed-particle hydrodynamics. Starting with some initial condition then relaxing it into a stable stellar structure and measure the star's density as a function of radius.
